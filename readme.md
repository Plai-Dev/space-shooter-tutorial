# Space Shooter Game

## Downloading Project Files
To download the project files just clone this repository onto your computer. 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Plai-Dev/space-shooter-tutorial.git
```

Then add the folder to Unity Hub and open it.
It will take some time initially because Unity will rebuild some files.
