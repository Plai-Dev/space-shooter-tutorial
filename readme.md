# Space Shooter Game

## Downloading Project Files
To download the project files just clone this repository onto your computer using

```
git clone https://github.com/Plai-Dev/space-shooter-tutorial.git
```

or any git client (like GitHub Desktop).

Then add the folder to Unity Hub and open it.
It will take some time initially because Unity will rebuild some files.
When the editor launches, you can open the scene from `Assets/Scenes/SampleScene`.
